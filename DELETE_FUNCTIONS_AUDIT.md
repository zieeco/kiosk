## üîí Security & Access Control

All delete functions require **admin access** except:

All delete functions include:
- ‚úÖ Authentication check (`getAuthUserId`)
- ‚úÖ Admin role verification (`requireAdmin`)
- ‚úÖ Audit logging
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialogs in UI

---

## üìä Data Integrity

### Cascade Delete Strategy
All delete functions follow a consistent pattern:
1. Verify user authentication and authorization
2. Check if record exists
3. Delete all dependent records (cascade)
4. Delete storage files if applicable
5. Update related records if needed
6. Delete the main record
7. Create audit log entry

### Preserved Data
Audit logs are **never deleted** to maintain compliance and historical records.

## üéØ Recommendations

### Current Implementation: ‚úÖ Production Ready

All delete functions are properly implemented with:
- Complete cascade deletes
- Proper validation checks
- Security controls
- Audit logging
- User confirmations

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Soft Deletes**: Consider implementing soft deletes for critical records (residents, employees) with a "deleted" flag instead of hard deletes
2. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk delete capabilities with transaction support
3. **Restore Functionality**: Implement a "trash" or "archive" system for accidental deletions
4. **Delete Scheduling**: Allow scheduling deletions for compliance periods
5. **Export Before Delete**: Automatically export data before deletion for backup
